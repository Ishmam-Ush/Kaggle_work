# Count negative numbers in a list

# Count negative numbers in a list using list comprehension
def count_negatives_comprehension(nums):
    return len([num for num in nums if num <0])
print(count_negatives_comprehension(numbers))  # This uses list comprehension to count the number of negative numbers in the list and prints the result.

# Different way of solbving the same problem
def count_negatives_alternative(nums):
    return sum([num < 0 for num in nums])
print(count_negatives_alternative(numbers)) ### whle printing why are we defining numbers instead of calling it nums as we have defined nums before not nums???
